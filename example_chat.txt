28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Guys today's q.
28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): All the elements of the input array will be consisting of '0' s and '1' s.
You have to output a single line
With all the 1's and then remaining 0's of the input array.

Input format :
Take n,After that next line contains, n spaced integers i.e a1,a2...an  denoting the elements of the array.

Output format :
Print a single line consisting of length n.

Sample input:
6
0 1 0 1 0 1

Sample output:
1 1 1 0 0 0

Explaination :
As we can see there are 3 ones and 3 zeros in the input array,So output is accordingly.
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Just a note

28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): It has something to do with how second condition of B is placed.
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - +91 99201 75875: Assuming you're not supposed to used in built sort functions right?
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Because if you reverse it. Write k first and then i
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): You get a totally different output
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): How???
28/01/2020, 7:39 pm - Tushar Nankani: Can you send the complete code? What is in the second printf?

28/01/2020, 7:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): In-built
28/01/2020, 7:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too.
28/01/2020, 7:49 pm - Tushar Nankani: The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10
28/01/2020, 7:50 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): So conclusion is
If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using "OR". And not "AND".
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But depends na

We've gotta manage our academics also along with coding

I know pointers don't matter much

But getting a decent pointer is important.....

If you all can
You'll should allocate specific time for coding....

29/01/2020, 10:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24.
To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): darshan sir told us to avoid statements like break if possible since it causes halt in the flow of the program abruptly and causes voltage fluctuations  (just telling this to you),so just keep that in mind

29/01/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 99201 75875: Let's say this is true then you could use the same logic and instead of writing it in main(),  make a separate function which just returned a Boolean and in the if statement replace break with return false and return true if the entire loop executes
And in main just call the function with the user input int

else in the room. Given the fact that any two persons shake hand exactly once, Can you tell the total
count of handshakes?
Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases T, T lines follow.
Each line then contains an integer N, the total number of Board of Directors of Acme.
Output Format
Print the number of handshakes for each test-case in a new line.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
0 < N < 10
Sample Input
2
1
2
Sample Output
0
1
Explanation
Case 1 : The lonely board member shakes no hands, hence 0.
Case 2 : There are 2 board members, 1 handshake takes place.

08/02/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And - 2^(no of bits-1) to 2^(no bits-1) -1 for signed
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 89764 07509: for int byte size req is 2 so since 1 byte =8 bits hence 2bytes=16 bits
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 89764 07509: therefore  2^(16)/2=32768

09/02/2020, 3:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

In C/C++ even after using the 'long long int' data type, we can compute factorial upto 20.

Today's challenge is to write a program in C/C++ to calculate fatorial of a number 'N'

where 0 <= N <= 100

0! = 1
1! = 1
50! = 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

12/02/2020, 8:40 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): My tips:
1)First get firm with language.
2)Do some good implementation q's.
3)In case your code gets *tle* just try to optimize by removing unnecessary nested for loops.

It is an easier one. Then to that one
14/02/2020, 7:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

You are given a *sorted* array NUM of *integers* as input.

You have to generate a *sorted* array SQ of the *squares* of the *integers* of the given array.

Constraints:

1 <= length(NUM) <= 10000
-10000 <= element of NUM <= 10000

This can be done in linear time complexity.
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Please try to do this without nested for loops
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Means ? What shud be the output?
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): An array of squares of the numbers
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): in the given array
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): this is out put

14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Understood bud
14/02/2020, 7:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): NUM = { -2 , -1 , 0, 3, 5}
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Output:

SQ = { 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 25 }
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Ok so first we have to find the squares
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Put it in another array
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Then sort it
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ya
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - +91 95949 08570: Correct?

14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): can be done using  better logic
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): only 1 for loop
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Kinda ascending? Descending?
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): see example

I had implemented a similar program in Java with Strings.
I have tested it with numbers upto 1000.

See if you can adapt the logic to work with arrays.

19/02/2020, 10:21 pm - +91 70394 60876: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.



*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.



*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!



*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109

From the array if you remove one element, the sum of the rest of the elements become divisible by 7.
In case of multiple such elements find the smallest one

21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Tushar Nankani: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.



*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.



*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!



*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109
21/02/2020, 12:42 am - Tushar Nankani: Take a string as an input from the user.
Make a new string of length 18 characters, containing random characters and the new string should also contain each and every letter of the input string(also distributed randomly).
Example
Input:
Controller
Output:

22/02/2020, 12:57 am - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): make one loop to print the number of spaces,     and  another one the print the values acc to the number of rows. eg row 2 will have 2 values. and increment value every time you print it
22/02/2020, 12:58 am - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): and for the main for loop,at the end , the spaces will be decremented by 1 , because its moving to the left
22/02/2020, 1:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): #include<stdio.h>

void main()
{
  int r, s, sp, data, n;

  printf("Please enter number of rows: ");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  data = 1;
  for(sp = 20, r = 1 ; r <= 5 ;r++,sp--)
  {
    for(s = 1 ; s <= sp ; s++)
    {
        printf("   ");
    }

    for(s = 1; s <= r; s++)
    {
      printf("%3d", data);
      data = data + 1;
    }

    printf("\n");

  }

22/02/2020, 10:05 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower you Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.

22/02/2020, 11:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also,
Many of us are  used to coding in an IDE or Text editor
the environment of Hackerrank/Codechef/Codeforces is very different
So a little into to that will be great
Like, most of the times, our solution is correct but because we did not print output in the way they wanted, it shows an error
22/02/2020, 11:04 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yes that'll be covered , dw
22/02/2020, 11:17 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): i find coding in text editor easier than hackerrank or other site Ide...u just upload the local file while submitting
22/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ya, but you gotta see how they take input and out put na
Consider testcases
make for loops and all
22/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): so that can be done in text editors too right..?
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yes
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But the problem is I can't analyse how they want input some times

01/03/2020, 10:57 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Instructions for the mashup:
You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

01/03/2020, 11:02 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Register before contest starts or else you won't be able to enter.
01/03/2020, 11:02 am - +91 79770 56210: Where can we find the conventions which we have to follow like using int main return 0 instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): use int main return 0
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): for some weird reason this doesn't work
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: But r there any other things that we need to know like this one
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No, nothing else
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): .
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: Ok
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): when you use void main program keeps on running?
01/03/2020, 11:05 am - +91 79770 56210: It runs in the ide but when i submit it it gives runtime error
01/03/2020, 11:08 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): i guess CodeForces's compiler expects a return value 0 to be returned from every program. If 0 is returned, it means program has been executed successfully. If anything other than that means something is wrong with the code.
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 79770 56210: Ohk
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 99693 94098: void main never worked with C89 or C99 anyway
Woh waise bhi error dega hi

03/03/2020, 10:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): If a[i] % m = a[j] % m for some i < j, then answer is 0. Otherwise there are <= m numbers, so you can calculate answer in O(N^2).

Integer.parseInt(in.readLine()); //for integer
in.readLine() //for String```

05/03/2020, 1:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
05/03/2020, 2:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because they have several disadvantages as well.
For example, in C++,
```cin.tie(NULL)``` means that you can input data while the program is printing to the screen.
```ios::sync_with_stdio(false)``` does not sync ```cout``` with ```printf```.

08/03/2020, 1:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:48 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.

15/03/2020, 11:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Example 2: This shows the creation and import of user-defined file.

Creating a user-defined header by the name of ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù.
// It is not recommended to put function definitions
// in a header file. Ideally there should be only
// function declarations. Purpose of this code is
// to only demonstrate working of header files.



void add(int a, int b)
{

    printf("Added value=%d\n", a + b);
}



void multiply(int a, int b)
{

    printf("Multiplied value=%d\n", a * b);
}
Created the main file where the above ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù will be included.
// C program to illustrate file inclusion
// <> used to import system header file
#include <stdio.h>


// " " used to import user-defined file
#include "process.h"


// main function

int main()
{

    // add function defined in process.h

    add(10, 20);



    // mult function defined in process.h

    mult(10, 20);



    // printf defined in stdio.h

    printf("Process completed");

    return 0;

15/03/2020, 7:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

1. hackerRank
2. HackerEarth
3. Codechef
4. Codeforces

Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first
Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces

Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated .
Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually.
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ok everyone so let's start
Road to CP
1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not.
Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something.
Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.
If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it.
Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible
2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP.
3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend)

"How to manage projects development and CP?"
Check out Rachit jain answer
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: One Important thing u have to insure that will doing CP ur growth and problem solving should increase exponentially.
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Please make sure u watch this video only after u have started with C++ and covered a large topics on it
Otherwise trees linked list all this things might become confusing for u.

But if ur in Second year ofcourse DSA has been covered in college so u should try to get comfortable with c++ within 2-3 weeks if u dont know c++ and then u can follow that with DSA
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: For FE students:
In college C language is covered by now,right? So learning c++ will be very easy BUT before properly learning c++ fundementals such as loops,arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic memory allocation etc and practicing questions on these topics
Don't dare to jump on DSA.
For Second year:
Ur now stepping in third after a few months so u should better take a placement course because if u delay now things will become overwhelming because u have to Also focus on projects and when it comes to placement along with problem solving skills they will check ur knowledge of Object oriented programming, Database management, Operating System, computer networks. Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.
What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.

Companies do see ur Website profile specially hackerRank while if u Solve practice contest questions on codechef ur rating is not gonna increase as far as I know ratings codechef increases only when we participate and solve in long challenge, lunchtime and cookoff.

18/03/2020, 11:27 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is an implicit call for the constructor.
You never explicitly call the constructor.
When you create a new obj of a class, you invoke the constructor of that class implicitly.
18/03/2020, 11:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Okay you can call another constructor explicitly from a constructor, but not otherwise.

18/03/2020, 12:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, yes, this is instantiation of an object, but how is this an implicit call?

You, the programmer, is explicitly writing ```new Object()```.

If this is an implicit call, then can you please give an example of an explicit call.
18/03/2020, 12:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Did you read the article?

I think that it is about constructor overloading using ```this```.
18/03/2020, 7:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/0CDKwzf0JxM
18/03/2020, 7:09 pm - +91 97739 65140: Ok so this is how I have learnt it.
In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class
Hence, implicit call
*But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation.
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: The second case will be explicit creation
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: *call
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You are mixing the default (implicit) constructor *definition* with implicit *calling*.
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When you define a class and do not provide a constructor, Java implicitly defines the default constructor.

But when you declare an object as ```Object obj```, *no constructor is called* and ```obj = null```.
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is unlike C++, where the non parameterized constructor is called implicitly.

21/03/2020, 1:18 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.
Good luck!

In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.

Internet services have become slow & there can be a complete breakdown, so lets not fwd VIDEOS ...

There is limited bandwidth only. It‚Äôs being heavily guzzled by OTTs steaming videos- Amazon/ hot star / Netflix.

Critical services  need to be prioritised.

 Internet providers are having a tough time keeping the telco facilities on with all sorts of lock down and mass apathy and no staff.

So please only use and watch what‚Äôs necessary and switch to non HD streaming

 üôè. And don‚Äôt forward non essential videos.

Else full shut down is not far. If they shut down

26/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): In today's world, basic programming skills are extremely advantageous in a tech driven world. You can use it to customise games, build your own websites and do things that you can't already do with your computer. As a computer engineering student I have done this before for first year engineering students and 8th grade students. During this time of curfew, I feel I should introduce even more people to this amazing skill.

The workshop shall be conducted online, as either a call or youtube live.

The workshop shall be completely free of charge.

Kindly register here if interested, and we'll decide on a time and date suitable for all

30/03/2020, 8:58 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Ig upper_bound will make it much simpler
30/03/2020, 9:11 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No, upper bound returns an iterator to the value just greater than X.

Lower bound returns an iterator to the value NOT LESS THAN 'X'. Means lower bound will return an iterator to the value if value is present the array . While upper bound will return an iterator to the element which is strictly greater than the value. If value is not present in the array it will return an iterator pointing to position just after vector_name.end().While lower bound will return an iterator pointing to the value.
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Then in this we might have to implement binary search

31/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): I embarked on my journey of learning and discovering  ML in the first year of Engineering, ever since each day is about figuring out fascinating developments in ML üìä
However this journey would not be easy if it weren't for the support of my seniors,mentors and the exposures I got being a part of committees in college.
Few days ago when people approached me for organizing an *ML workshop*, I thought there was no better way to reciprocate the support and push I had received myself when I started some years back.
So I will be organising a workshop on ML:

*Where:* Online

*Time:* next week, time suitable to all

*Cost*: üÜì

Lets make the most of the time, that we have in abundance due to lockdown, to discover and gain a basic idea as to what ML is!
*Those interested please fill out the form:*  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRAs17JL2S7Ynm5LdHXLEmkzZ2mIONcXPgGSaKdwKJNDXjBA/viewform?usp=sf_link

31/03/2020, 2:25 pm - Tushar Nankani: <Media omitted>
31/03/2020, 3:36 pm - Tushar Nankani: This ML Workshop would be directed in a way to introduce all interested to the world of ML (it is kinda impossible to teach everything in a workshop, but its a good idea to get started on it.)
31/03/2020, 3:37 pm - Tushar Nankani: The workshop would consist of the following topics:
Numpy and Pandas
Data Preprocessing(using Numpy and Pandas)
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
31/03/2020, 3:39 pm - Tushar Nankani: The above three are branches of ML. A proper introduction would be given, along with one or two models in it for understanding. Though there will be a prerequisite of python, but he'll be going through the basics at the start.
He will try to explain a few projects, share the code for us to understand.

04/04/2020, 10:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In 1st statement, variable ```fruits``` is an ArrayList, and in second statement, it is of type List.
List is an abstract class, so it cannot be instantiated directly.
List is used to group several different implementations of Lists, like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.
04/04/2020, 10:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Both statements have almost identical functionality, the only difference is that if you want to change the implementation for any reason, you will have to update all the code.
The second statement allows you to hide the actual list implementation.
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ty
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It gives a warning

05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No: ```error: List is abstract; cannot be instantiated```.

05/04/2020, 12:18 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Gives issues
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Collection is an interface and List extends Collection and itself is an interface as well
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Then ArrayList,LinkedList etc are classes in List

05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because Collection is also generic.

05/04/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 97681 67131: Given a string of digits S, insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses.
Let the nesting of two parentheses within a string be the substring that occurs strictly between them. An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m.
For example, in the following strings, all digits match their nesting depth: 0((2)1), (((3))1(2)), ((((4)))), ((2))((2))(1). The first three strings have minimum length among those that have the same digits in the same order, but the last one does not since ((22)1) also has the digits 221 and is shorter.
Given a string of digits S, find another string S', comprised of parentheses and digits, such that:
all parentheses in S' match some other parenthesis,
removing any and all parentheses from S' results in S,
each digit in S' is equal to its nesting depth, and
S' is of minimum length.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line represents a test case and contains only the string S.
Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the string S' defined above.
Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 100.
1 ‚â§ length of S ‚â§ 100.
Test set 1 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is either 0 or 1.
Test set 2 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is a decimal digit between 0 and 9, inclusive.
Sample

Input

4
0000
101
111000
1

Output
Case #1: 0000
Case #2: (1)0(1)
Case #3: (111)000
Case #4: (1)


The strings ()0000(), (1)0(((()))1) and (1)(11)000 are not valid solutions to Sample Cases #1, #2 and #3, respectively, only because they are not of minimum length. In addition, 1)( and )(1 are not valid solutions to Sample Case #4 because they contain unmatched parentheses and the nesting depth is 0 at the position where there is a 1.
You can create sample inputs that are valid only for Test Set 2 by removing the parentheses from the example strings mentioned in the problem statement.

07/04/2020, 1:58 am - +91 77150 51136: (String) is not requiredüòÖ
07/04/2020, 1:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah figured it out
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But when is it required then
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean its a non-primitive data type right?
07/04/2020, 2:11 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (String) al.get(0); is explicit typecasting.
It is only required when your code is not typesafe.

If you make a generic (Object) ArrayList as: ```List al = new ArrayList();```, then you will need to typecast the objects while using get.
07/04/2020, 2:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is the reason why it is always encouraged to have a datatype in the ArrayList.
07/04/2020, 2:15 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Side note: If you have a generic ArrayList, then code like this will work.
```List al = new ArrayList();
al.add("Abcd");
al.add(10);
al.add(true);```

11/04/2020, 3:16 pm - Tushar Nankani: It says every even letter is uppercase. Which means index i should be odd.
11/04/2020, 3:16 pm - Tushar Nankani: But then it shows this error.
11/04/2020, 3:17 pm - Tushar Nankani: You deleted this message
11/04/2020, 3:18 pm - +91 94208 78848: It shouldn't matter, in the question its mentioned only the alternating pattern matters and not the first charachter
11/04/2020, 3:18 pm - +91 94208 78848: It should accept both
11/04/2020, 3:19 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): It does
There can't be 2 solutions
11/04/2020, 3:19 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yeah. I read that but it does show an error.
11/04/2020, 3:21 pm - Tushar Nankani: So apparently, in this question indexes start from 1.

11/04/2020, 8:27 pm - +91 97681 67131: It is a iterator in python used to return values of a specific data type in a list, tuple, string or dictionaries
11/04/2020, 8:32 pm - Tushar Nankani: Map function is used to execute a function (defined) or also with the lambda expression and the values to be executed are also passed through.
11/04/2020, 8:32 pm - Tushar Nankani: ```map(func, *iterables)```
11/04/2020, 8:33 pm - +91 97027 35002: Got it
11/04/2020, 8:38 pm - +91 97681 67131: Can someone help me with a example and explaination of the usage of abstract classes and interfaces in Java
11/04/2020, 8:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): @917506412914 @918080142783
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If you work in an organisation and you need to follow a certain structure, an interface can be used to have uniformity of structure, but difference of implementations.

Interfaces help to maintain uniformity and consistency.
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 73043 57388: Interfaces are used when objects have common properties

For example
Students common properties are
Nane roll no DOB
Etc
So student class can be parent class
And student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc
So these branches becomes child classes
11/04/2020, 8:48 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Abstract classes can be used when you want to enforce only certain functions in that class and leave a choice for the other functions to be used or not.

The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns
11/04/2020, 8:52 pm - +91 73043 57388: Oh sorry this is Inheritance explanation ü§¶
11/04/2020, 8:53 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah
11/04/2020, 9:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread.
Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.

Classes provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class.
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah makes sense
Thank you
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - +91 97681 67131: So a superclass can inherit multiple such interfaces whereas it can only inherit one abstract class right?
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The PARENT class is called superclass.
Child classes are called subclasses.

In Java, one (sub)class can only inherit from one superclass, and multiple interfaces.

Note: C++ allows multiple inheritance.
11/04/2020, 9:08 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): A child class*

12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: are while loops slower than for loops?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: or is slicing the problem?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: if anyone knows pls tell
12/04/2020, 6:47 pm - Tushar Nankani: I think nested loops increases time a lot more in python. Initially, I used while and for; which gave me TLE.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Therefore, alternative would be by taking that counter ```k```, avoiding the while loop.

12/04/2020, 7:17 pm - +91 77150 51136: Maybe you can use replace
12/04/2020, 7:43 pm - +91 97681 67131: replace will remove all occurences of given character from string so i think will not work
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: It also has count parameter
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: You can use that
12/04/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 97681 67131: ya wait let me try if it accepts that

12/04/2020, 8:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: There are three things increasing time complexity i think upon trying to run various versions in time it :
12/04/2020, 8:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: 1) s.count(char) != 0: instead just in operator works for checking
2) using lists therefore inturn using ranges for them as @919820487592 said they are more efficient and also thus while loop causing more time

Because I didn't knew about previous allegations on him and even now it's not 100% sure whether or not he has done it( but it seems most probably that he really cheated that's because he has deleted all his social media handles) so I suggested him.
It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

18/04/2020, 9:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): How do we exactly solve problems involving subsets?like what should be our approach?
18/04/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: Recursion
18/04/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: ?

18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Its a Div 2 A problem
18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No need of recursion
18/04/2020, 10:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): If there is an even element in array there is an answer consisting of only it. Otherwise if there is at least two odd elements in array there is an answer consisting of this two elements. Otherwise array is only one odd element and there is no answer.

18/04/2020, 11:12 pm - +91 73043 57388: The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem
For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion

For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers
Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one

So suppose u have
Given array 1 2 3 4
And u wan to find all possible subsets

We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop

For(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
   temp[0]=arr[i];
   Recursion_func
}

We draw a recursion tree for that
18/04/2020, 11:13 pm - +91 73043 57388: Explaination of recursion function I will give u tomorrow if u don't mind

25/04/2020, 12:10 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Difficult choice between Python and Kotlin.
25/04/2020, 12:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why tho?
25/04/2020, 12:25 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Python gone means a lot of stuff from this field gone and Kotlin gone means bye-bye android applications
25/04/2020, 12:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, just the LANGUAGE, not the all the programs. I just don't like Python's syntax.
98% of android apps are written in Java even today. Kotlin was supposed to reduce the boilerplate needed for Java.
But, in Kotlin, you have to type ```val a: int;```. In Java, it is ```int a;``` now which one is shorter?
25/04/2020, 12:49 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Kotlin is now official Android language ig
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, unfortunately. But most of the Android api's are still in Java, and even today, you cannot make an Android app without using at least some Java.
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But both languages are JVM compatible, so I will stick to Java, at least for now.

30/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 99693 94098: Hey everyone,
I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.
After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus
Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.

My suggestions:
- Tell the user that a left swipe on a note will delete it (add a small line of text at the head)
- On the profile page at the bottom, add your name in the fol. format: 'Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Gaurav Raj' (with Gaurav Raj being a hyperlink to your social media. Your project is open source, so add a link to your repo for contributions...)
- Further features:
-- Notifications / reminders (take both time & date)
-- Add a choice to input some description as well.

Just my opinions and suggestions, you're free to do as you want to!

Awesome work on the app. Keep building and preferably keep building up on one or two project(s) rather than making too many projects.

Keep going!

 --> Some small suggestions from my side.
- When we re-edit the note, try changing the date and time, as "last edited".
- When we tap on the picture to change the profile, it opens up the camera directly. Maybe try adding another option, asking access for the gallery, so as to select the image from the gallery.

Looks amazing! Keep it up! ^_^

03/05/2020, 7:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Codeforces Round #639: the round is rescheduled.

Hello, Codeforces!

Unfortunately, I report that I decided to reschedule this round. I'm afraid that something might go wrong. Some strange database behavior has appeared, which leads to slow operation in completely unexpected places (it never was and should not be). I will work hard to fix it. My recent tests show that this can dramatically increase judging time (and leads to a huge queue). I don't want to risk the efforts of the writer, the coordinator, testers, and your time. Sorry about it, I was trying to fix it for many hours but I need more time. Hope it will be a great round!

Mike.

UPD: I temporarily rescheduled it on May, 6. But I'll discuss the date with the writer and coordinator and reschedule it again to the date they want.

03/05/2020, 9:16 pm - Tushar Nankani: *Sort 10 billion numbers*

10 billion numbers are given, sort them


*Approach 1 :-  (External Sorting)*
Here k is the size of maximum elements which  can be sorted internally.
Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose.
1) Divide the numbers in group of k.
2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )
    Merge sort all the groups.
3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k.
4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group.
5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file.
6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged.
7) Update the min heap.
8) Go to step 5.



*Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*

1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.
   The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements.
2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.
   If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.
   Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group.
3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ.
4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order.
5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.

_In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._
_where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._

05/05/2020, 1:23 pm - Tushar Nankani: You're basically assigning i = 0. And then incrementing the value to 1. But i is already assigned as 0. This process keeps getting repeated.

05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Tushar Nankani: It's due to the post increment. If it was pre-increment: i = ++i, then it will increment to 1, then assign it to i. So in this case i remains 1.

08/05/2020, 1:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 1) All pending semester exams (except final semester) are effectively cancelled in Maharashtra.
2) Marks will be given according to UGC guidelines i.e. 50% marks based on this SEM internal assessment and 50% based on last semester exam performance.
3) If you are unhappy with this Sem marks, University will announce dates for Re-Exam which will probably be a 80 mark paper (not clarified as to of how many marks the re exam will be)
4) All those who fail in this Sem internal assessment will have to give exams in next sem or the Re-Exam as notified by the University.
5) All those already having ATKT in previous Sems will have to give exams for them within 120 days of college reopening, the timetable for which will be announced by respective university.

11/05/2020, 8:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, I thought that this was a native program. If you converted a .py file then it bundles the python interpreter as well.

20/05/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I prefer GitLab.
20/05/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): They have integrated CI/CD.
20/05/2020, 7:25 pm - +91 99201 75875: Even GitHub has CI/CD
GitHub Actions
20/05/2020, 7:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but it is not as powerful.
20/05/2020, 7:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You still have to use Travis.
20/05/2020, 7:27 pm - +91 99201 75875: Not necessarily

20/05/2020, 7:29 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh okay
20/05/2020, 7:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For eg, I can setup a GitLab CI action to run only when I push to a certain branch, and then automatically build, package and deploy a site, with different production and development instances.
Try doing that with GitLab Actions. Trust me, I have tried.
20/05/2020, 8:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Is Git Hub Devops?ü§î
20/05/2020, 8:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Learn about Git, GitHub and more on: https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/
20/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Git is a part of DevOps.
GutHub is just a platform.
GitHub has other DevOps features like CI/CD.

@918080142783 am I correct?
20/05/2020, 9:35 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This can be done with GitHub Actions.

Haven't experimented with CI/CD yet, so you might be right about the complicated nature of GitHub to that of GitLab. I have no idea...
20/05/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Almost.
GitHub has tried to integrate CI/CD into the workflow like GitLab.
20/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohüëç

Javascript can be
Mavascript or Ravascript for foodies
For people who don't like this language, it can be Tavascript

28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I struggled with Javascript methods of Materialize CSS

They need a better docs....

28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is why I always advice: *DON'T USE LIBRARIES*.

28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yuppp
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So plain CSS is the way to go?
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Vanilla* CSS
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In my opinion: Always.
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): CSS => Complete Suffering & Sadness
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh....
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Definitely look to libraries for inspiration, and feel free to copy whatever you like.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Smart!
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This way, you aren't really using the library, but you also are ......
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
Alright
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ESPECIALLY CSS/JavaScript libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh ..
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects...
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Unless the library ADDS critical functionality (eg: PDF parser, WebSocket management) you should think twice before using it.
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, the decision is up to you, but I don't like to use these libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What is a CDN is used?
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If*
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We're having real talks at 2.35 AM
This is fucking awesome!!!!!
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üëèüëè
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A CDN can only speed up the download times.
28/05/2020, 2:36 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...

Now if you're saying that that code is a lot as compared to when done with vanilla CSS, then you have to be good at that...

My vanilla CSS with flexbox looks like this:
https://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page/
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which seems like a MASSIVE waste.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You sure do have a point
But what if, I say I'm not really concerned abt frontend
I don't want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....

I just want to show off my backend functionality.....
Then what should I do?
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): True true
28/05/2020, 2:41 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): However, there is something called "Tree Shaking" where unused portions of the library are removed.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you lose the benefit of a CDN.
28/05/2020, 2:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, what backend functionality?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Give me an example.
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Suppose, I'm building a rest api..
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Tbh I used a template for Attendance Manager v1
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It was just a backend project then...
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeahh
You told me once ...
Now I remember....
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end...
28/05/2020, 2:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): No idea what should be done...
28/05/2020, 2:49 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't use flex box..
Why do you need??
28/05/2020, 2:50 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Bootstrap handles it all na?
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether.
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Try CSS Grid.
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh that is absolute beauty  .....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I've used it ....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Its lengthy,
But it works...
It works perfectly
It works always....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Somebody put it nicely: "Grid is how CSS should have been designed in the first place".
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Now, that you say it.....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üî•üî•
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Are you on Twitter M
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?*
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh okay.....
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is v2 on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wanted to tag ya
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh, ok.
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I am not sure that using a server is important.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It will greatly reduce the load on the server.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also,
It  gives us a better understanding of what actually is happening....
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You know, what you have coded and
That's what you are seeing...
Not some pre written code, which you are using.....
28/05/2020, 3:03 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There's one thing I give you,
The satisfaction of building a complete thing, from scratch, on our own, line by line is üòçüòçüòçüòç
28/05/2020, 3:07 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The satisfaction of finishing a project is much greater.
I would say that if you feel that the only way that you can finish a project is to use a library, then go for it.
But you should definitely try to do at least one project without a library.
28/05/2020, 3:08 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): True!
I'll complete this project, with a library,
But the next one is definitely gonna be VANILLA EVERYTHING
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you want to try vanilla, your mother's website is a great project.https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is better to have a long, scrolling page that has all the images instead of having 5 links that people have to click on.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is NEVER a good idea.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It makes it very difficult to view all the images.
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohhh
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I thought, it made things easier to view category wise.....
28/05/2020, 3:15 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you would have only suggested me before I started!
Anyways...
Next time!
28/05/2020, 3:16 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but if I want to view all the images, then I have to click on each link, then click 20 times on the >> button.
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yaa....
What I'll do is.....
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll create a grid of all images
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If someone wants to see an enlarged view, I'll add something like a pop-up feature
When the user clicks on a particular image....
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even now is not too late.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is exactly what I had in mind.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like Google Images.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Cool!
My Gallery page is sorted now!
Thanks @918080142783
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Let me know if you need help.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sure!!
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, a solid background color is quite boring.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's a gradient....
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What?
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah....
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Well, it looks like a solid color.
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wait
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Which one are you talking about?
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm talking about this one....
28/05/2020, 3:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Pick a gradient somewhere like https://uigradients.com/ .
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh, I thought you were talking about https://dheerajdlalwani.github.io/ImageGallery/
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah,
That was old version
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The new one looks good, but the transitions seem a little... too flashy.
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What about a simple, left to right translate?
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That was like the first thing that popped up in Materialize CSS docsüòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll change it to that
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is the new website on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Less is always more!
Minimalistic design....
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not hosted though
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll send the link
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know about http://htmlpreview.github.io/
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Noo!
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll check it out!
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, it's a Django project
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): WHY?
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's a shop!üòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): E commerce
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So?
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll be adding payment gateways and all
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): E - commerce only makes sense if you will be getting at least 10 orders per day.
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): For practicing!!!
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üòÖüòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Last time I checked, the seller registration was like 10,000 per month.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It might be better to take orders via phone or email.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm making this project to just explore....
And see how it feels ......
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Getting comfy with the tech...
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): My mom takes all orders via phone only.....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even then, building a payment gateway is not easy.
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I've to just integrate right?
They're like ready made I saw in some Tutorials.....
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you seriously want to learn about accepting online payments, then it might be better to look into a payment service like BillDesk or Shopify.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm.....
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you only want to integrate with an existing provider then you might be able to use the REST api directly.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Without the need for a server.
28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay...
This is more like PC
Let's pc
28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK.

This guy has a *GREAT* point

Do reade the complete thread
01/06/2020, 11:59 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Damn, this is unique!

What are your thoughts @919689727471 and @918408867834?
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would suggest spending at least 30 minutes on each problem.
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But otherwise, this is great advice.
02/06/2020, 12:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hmm.....
02/06/2020, 12:12 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): This can be done for interview questions as they are repetitive. But in Cp, questions aren't that repetitive. Every question has something new. That's why for cp, you have to think for an hour at least on every problem that's hard for you. People spend days solving a single question in CodeChef Long Challenge(8 questions 10 days to solve). Questions are hard. But you get learn 5-6 different concepts by solving a single question.
02/06/2020, 12:14 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is if you're doing it for the love of CP, right? Would you recommend this for interviews as well?
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If you want to do hardcore cp then this might good for starting
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This is what i think
02/06/2020, 12:17 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): I haven't started with interview questions yet. But yeah you should think for an hour at least. That'll improve your problem solving skills. And in interviews, they won't ask you questions which are already there on gfg(for FAANG companies). They'll always slightly change the question. To solve the question during interview you should have excellent problem solving skills.

05/06/2020, 3:47 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This is literally dangerous !!!
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yes its deep
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't attempt to download the image
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): At any cost....
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Where can it be accessed butüòÖ?
05/06/2020, 3:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Follow the video
05/06/2020, 3:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do reverse Google image search
05/06/2020, 3:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, highly not  recommended
05/06/2020, 3:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you want to use your phone....
05/06/2020, 4:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, at the end of the video, he said that he could not replicate the bug with any other photo.
05/06/2020, 4:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I think that it should not be too difficult.
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So can someone please test this on an EMULATOR. I don't want to factory reset mine.

05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - +91 86559 19035: Usme bas ek pixel ka issue hai all the max values for RGB pixel are 255 and there's a formula to calculate the number for each R G B pixel and it actually comes around 254 and due to approximation of the formula to the nearest integer in Android it calculate the value as 256 and when you apply it you are screwed
It's prophoto RGB image so don't try it out
05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I wanted to check if using a custom launcher (like Nova Launcher) affects things.
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - +91 86559 19035: Nope it won't
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
05/06/2020, 4:10 pm - +91 86559 19035: When You set a wallpaper it is set in your system even if the app crashes the wallpaper won't change since you set it and there starts the loop crashes
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The issue is that the system restarts the home process, which crashes, then restarts, then crashes, etc.
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - +91 86559 19035: Loop yes
05/06/2020, 4:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If the wallpaper is a third party launcher, then the system will use the default home process.
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - +91 86559 19035: Go ahead try to install a launcher apply a wallpaper not that one and then uninstall the launcher the wallpaper stays the same
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - +91 86559 19035: Same matlab jo launcher se apply kiya tha
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): read the comments sectionüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): On my (Oppo) phone, whenever Nova Launcher crashes, the launcher changes to the system launcher, and the wallpaper resets.
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - +91 86559 19035: You may try applying your luck then
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definately NOT.
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is why I am asking someone to try in an emulator.
05/06/2020, 4:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Send this to Kajli ma'am @917738557601
05/06/2020, 4:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Problem solve teraüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I am not sure that she is capable of setting a wallpaper üòÇ.
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Downloading it is enough na
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, it has to be SET as a wallpaper.
05/06/2020, 4:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): * or displayed by the system in some manner, but then the system can just kill the task.
05/06/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'll try this when I get some time. Sounds like fun
If anything goes wrong, nandroid backup wtg üòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): All of you know how to use an emulator, right?
05/06/2020, 4:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yup
05/06/2020, 4:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then WHY do you want to experiment on your phone?
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Because I want to wipe it anyway before I permanently switch to Paranoid Android so might as well try this out
Plus this doesn't crash all phones so who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK that makes sense.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I prefer Lineange OS.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Lineage is too plain for my taste üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: Also a nandroid backup is an ultimate backup so it's nothing more than a simple experiment
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then try Resurrection Remix (RR).
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: That's outdated. No Q build either
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I know, but it is still better to NOT brick your phone.
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: RR hasn't been updated for a very long time actually
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: I've bricked mine wayyy too many times üòÇüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: Even had to go to stores to replace the motherboard a couple of times
05/06/2020, 5:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://get.resurrectionremix.com/?dir=ten
05/06/2020, 5:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Very few devices are supported, but you can find unofficial roms on androidfilehost.com
05/06/2020, 5:05 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know that already buddy
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: And I don't want to build on my own so I'm just avoiding it
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 88798 05171: rr is pretty old now, devs stopped compiling it because it was pretty unstable
05/06/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: and obv new roms came out which were better
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: I spoke to Akhil Narang who has a big contribution in RR and he said the same thing
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: The best ROM imo is AOSiP
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nothing beats it
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 88798 05171: ive been into this shit since galaxy yüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Well, the last build was on 1 June, so I don't know.
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Same üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Why wouldn't they merge the security patch and release it instead? ü§î
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Omg same phone same story üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: I think galaxy young or something it was called
05/06/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 99693 94098: I guess most people started with samsung. Mostly because of shitty TouchWiz üòÇüòÇ

05/06/2020, 5:23 pm - +91 99693 94098: Use password for your recovery and you're done. What more security would you ever need?
05/06/2020, 5:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: There was a themer called good lock or something. That was the best thing that came out if samsung at that time üòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:35 pm - +91 97681 67131: I think was part of Samsung theme park/manager whatever they called... üòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:36 pm - +91 99693 94098: Oh the things samsung did to hide their shit üòÇüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Future of Futchia OS seems nice now but biggest issue is unlike android which works on Linux based kernel it works on Google made custom microkernel I think which makes providing apps on App Store difficult if google is able to nail the process of transfer of apps it would be replacing android then...
05/06/2020, 5:40 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... a lot don‚Äôt use google chrome browser use our Samsung browser.. don‚Äôt use EA file explorer use Samsung files and so on lots of dual apps too... üòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:44 pm - +91 99693 94098: Not to mention all of Samsung's assistants üòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): S. Voice was the shittiest.
05/06/2020, 5:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Bixby was promising, but
Google Assistant ruled the assistant world.
05/06/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... remember now it lacked basic core reminder setting features too üòÇ Bixby is much better in comparison..

05/06/2020, 5:47 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Seen*
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No matter, how much ever shitty Samsung is,
I'd always prefer Samsung over MIUI or Huawei or any other crappy Chinese OS
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): What happened to Freedom 257 thingüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:49 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I used Mi a while back,

05/06/2020, 5:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes,it turns out it was some shitty Chinese phone
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The worst scandal going on rn is the Escobar Inc. Wala üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Google it once
And see
MKBHD's & Mr. Who's The Boss's video
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - +91 97681 67131: Agreed... but not for that alone, Samsung‚Äôs r and d team is awesome no fold would have been possible without Samsung and there would be no edge/curved display devices without them they keep competition going if only Apple were there... u know üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeahh
05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - +91 97681 67131: Saw re.. They are biggest scam
05/06/2020, 5:52 pm - +91 99693 94098: True. Mi is so shit that you have to ask for their permission for bootloader unlock and uske baad bhi you have to wait for a minimum of 15days before you can actually do it. Biggest scam ever
05/06/2020, 5:53 pm - +91 97681 67131: I loved their irony buying ripapple.com and rip Samsung.com and selling their refurbished phones only by rebranding themüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 88798 05171: But they have everything you want
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 97681 67131: These days I think all phones do it started by moto and Lenovo but it improves Androids privacy by having a locked bootloader it‚Äôs actually good as it makes hard to exploit a device with locked bootloader
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: There's no developement for op7
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: Its my first unrooted phoneüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: 15 days wait time for a phone that I bought? Why can't I just unlock it immediately if I want to? Your device is linked to your mi account anyway so there's no way anyone else can do it
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: There is so much development for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know like 3-4 main devs that develop for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Thats for pro
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nahi nahi
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Been a while I've checked XDA
05/06/2020, 5:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Karle. Kaafi saare ROMs hai OP7 ke liye
05/06/2020, 5:59 pm - +91 88798 05171: Jab mene dekha tha tab lineage tak nahi tha
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know op7 ka PE dev. Baalaji. He used to develop for my device before
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - +91 97681 67131: Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that‚Äôs the reason locked bootloader are better
05/06/2020, 6:02 pm - +91 97681 67131: Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back

I'm saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it. If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use?
Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader

10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Do you make gists for everything you do?
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ohh great
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll hit you up in 3 days
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Documentation is VERY important!
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Personally, could not recommed Docker highly enough.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I'm not really good mdüòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MUCH better than WSL, as you can have separate, disposable containers.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah even Docker is amazing and it's supported via a nice GUI if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Docker has started supporting Win 10 Home as well
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, that is with VirtualBox.
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I think they did away with that in the 2004 version. Not sure though...
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But updataing to Pro is trivial.

https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/KMS-activator
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 10/10 would recommend.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Especially if you want to work with large projects.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah I never said that you should upgrade to Pro
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Explain this is simple terms lol
10/06/2020, 6:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Windows has an in-built mechanic to check activation with *any* Key Management Server (KMS).
This is usually used in corporate enviorments where internet access is a security issue.
But you can setup a KMS server ON THE SAME PC and Windows will happily ask the server if the liscence is still valid.
10/06/2020, 6:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Is it like piracy?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh lol üòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Why have they not done something to solve it!?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the exchange goes like this:
Windows to Server: Is my license still valid?
Server to Windows: Of course! üòâ
Windows: OK then.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but you are not modifying the software, just using in-built mechanisms in un-intended ways.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ironically it is hosted on GitHubüòÇüòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes. But not a lot of people know about this or have the patience to read the README.
10/06/2020, 6:34 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That will be VERY difficult, since Microsoft mainly relys on the backwords-compatibility of Windows. Otherwise all businesses would have switched to Linux.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can actually run a Windows 98 program on Windows 10 and it shoud run fine.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): PS: This works for Office as well.

12/06/2020, 10:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Dude why don't you use an IDE like IntelliJ ,it will be easier to debug then
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): int x is not declared
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): X is not defined inside prime
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
12/06/2020, 10:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Actually, he is doing a great job.
12/06/2020, 10:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes getting used to command line...but as a beginner better to use an IDE like BlueJ
12/06/2020, 10:38 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But no one is going to tell you that their should be written in a notepad or something
12/06/2020, 10:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I too like to use the command line for simple programs, but USE AN EDITOR.
Notepad++ is a good standalone editor. So is VSCode.
But DON'T USE NOTEPAD.
12/06/2020, 10:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
12/06/2020, 10:40 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): IDE's help you a lot!!!
12/06/2020, 10:43 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly
You don't want the beginner to get too much help
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Then you use Bluej
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its just perfect,just like a text editor,no auto-complete
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Why??üôÑüò∂
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The beginner should be able to figure it out himself, where he went wrong
Rather than the ide just helping him fix the errors
12/06/2020, 10:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ide does show you the errors
12/06/2020, 10:53 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And getting stuck at such a trivial issues is so demotivating for a beginner
12/06/2020, 10:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is true
12/06/2020, 11:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I know
Been there....
But,
I also used an IDE only....
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But I realized, in order to get perfect....
I would have done better if I had done it on a simple text editor
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do watch Tech With Tim's video on this topic
12/06/2020, 11:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/oij82Cp9K1A
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I feel that
Immediate help is harmful
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Notepad++ provides only syntax highlighting. I think that is a quite helpfully, especially for a beginner.
12/06/2020, 11:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bluej is the best for beginners imo,we used that in school too
12/06/2020, 11:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not using an IDE is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels.
Yes, it is possible but there is no major benefit.
12/06/2020, 11:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True that
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Which language?
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Python
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C++
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I find Python impossible to code without an IDE.
Especially without a mononspace font. I really don't like the syntax.
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ahh
I know thatüòÖüòÖ
12/06/2020, 11:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Python have a really steep learning curve for people from another language which have brackets
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): It's very hard to get used to those whitespaces
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Its not just the whitespaces, Python has vary strange behaviour.
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *very.
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): IküòÇ

12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): JAVA ALLOWS THIS.
C++ ALLOWS THIS.
BOTH ARE MORE STRONGLY TYPED THAN PYTHON.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And initializing multi-dimension arrays is horrible.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If you are using a statically typed language ide helps a lot
12/06/2020, 11:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you are using a ~statically typed~ language ide helps a lot.
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And i can't find a reason of not using an ide if you are always going to use an ide

12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Another disadvantage that its Dynamically typed

12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is a good learning experience, you should know how to compile programs.
Syntax hilighing is a different story.
There is no good reason to not use syntax hilighting.
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have literally seen solutions in Perl which kill a huge solution in a line
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): On codeforces
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I never wrote a line of code without an ide but still ik what error I'm getting. What i feel is that learning a language takes time but demotivating yourself of by getting stuck at simple issues is not acceptable.
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is less about the error and more about knowing how to work with simple tools.
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I gave example of error
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Syntax highlighting is necessary
But,
Autocomplete nahi yaar...
I've grown so used to it
That
I keep forgetting the syntax
12/06/2020, 11:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Except in certain circumstances (Static code analysis), all the IDE does is display the error thrown by the compiler in a different way.
You should know how to read throught logs and error messages to find what is relevant.
12/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its a nightmare to read the logs
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ganda hai par dhanda haiüòÇüòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > I keep forgetting the syntax
There is NO GOOD REASON to remember syntax. Can you remember every word in the dictionary? Then why do you want to memorize an entire language
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Interview purpose

How better your Googling Skills are....

But for the sake of efficiency
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If, we have this rigid practice of typing out the whole code.....

12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then, couple that with the autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This makes it faster

I would suggest switching to VS Code for web dev though. Lmk if you want links to set up VS Code (extensions and stuff).

Keep asking!
25/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): He told project-based will help you a lot in the long run.
You might miss out on the nitty gritties of the particular language. But that's fine.
For beginners, what should do is, find a course which teaches by walking through a particular project. That would be really beneficial.
25/06/2020, 11:37 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Definitely agree with this!

Get started with a quick tutorial and then learn as per requirements...

26/06/2020, 10:46 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But remember,
Chrome was the first browser to bring the concept of Threading.
That means if multiple tabs are open, and if one tab hangs, rest all work.
Before that, in firefox, if there are 10 tabs open and if 1 tab also stops working
It used to crash the browser.
Everyone else copied.

26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah, but people are slowly migrating imo.

Brave, Edge, Firefox and some of the popular ones...

I personally use Edge because Microsoft atleast optimizes its perf (even though it is Chromium)
26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Are*

So I was thinking most of us want to start with ML ,DAta science , AI but don‚Äôt exactly know where to start from, so I‚Äôm forming a group where we‚Äôll start working on projects together . We‚Äôll start with v basic projects starting from Python ke basics and will go on aage (ITS OKAY IF YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW MUCH WE ALL ARE LEARNING HERE )

- we will refer to 1YouTube video focusing on 1 project for a week and try to make and learn on our own .
- if we don‚Äôt understand any concept or anything from the video we‚Äôlltry to reverse engineer it and help others in the group as well.

People who are interested can join this group

 You all can share it with people if you want

 Also I was thinking it‚Äôll be great if we put up our projects on GitHub as it‚Äôll help us keep a record of our progress so Harsh Kapadia‚Å© has decided to help us with Git and GitHub. He will be taking a live hands on session tomorrow(ie Sunday)
and I have posted a poll  regarding the same there please join the group and vote so we know when to keep the session

28/06/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75078 05454: This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 75078 05454: It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): How exactly/
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is an app development platform, right?
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 75078 05454: They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used .
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, that makes some sense.

28/06/2020, 10:02 pm - +91 75078 05454: The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): My point exactly.
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - +91 75078 05454: But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind.
28/06/2020, 10:05 pm - +91 75078 05454: ?
28/06/2020, 10:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 75078 05454: From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses
28/06/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 75078 05454: But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress
28/06/2020, 10:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open.
28/06/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is true.
28/06/2020, 10:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic.
28/06/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeah that's true
28/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Same. Even I was surprised when I read that üòÇ

Mujhe decimal point ke baad 1000 numbers chahiye for example toh kaise karu
01/07/2020, 5:14 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): F aaisa kya kar raha hai?
01/07/2020, 5:14 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeh competition ka question hai naa?
01/07/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes
01/07/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 73043 57388: Actually i am getting

Only 5 numbers after . Point
01/07/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 75078 05454: I tried by importing Decimal in python
01/07/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 99204 26955: try fixed and set precision I guess
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ya but it seems they are only used while printing a double number

I wanna store number

01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 75078 05454: I converted it to a string
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You will have to use arrays.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Or a string.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): hmm
01/07/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes we will convert it to a string but first the numbers p and q are divided then their result is stored in string
01/07/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 73043 57388: I even used long double but still doesn't getting more than 5 digits
01/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You will have to do the division process in small small steps
01/07/2020, 5:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And store the number decimal by decimal by appending the string.
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There was a similar problem on code chef
Where you had to find the factorial of numbers > 21
Suppose you have to calculate 100!
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You have to write a special algorithm for division
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): correct
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): simulate the division process
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I have the solution for this.
You can read and then write the required algorithm for division.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yess.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): and keep adding

```>>> f = 1

>>> f

06/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It would be better if you can tell us what exactly you are trying to do.
06/07/2020, 8:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm trying to create tables.

For example, if I do it normally, in MySQL, I can use foreign key to links 2 tables.

I want to understand
How to do that using classes in Python.

But, never mind, I'll look it up and experiment so that, understand.
06/07/2020, 8:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I was looking for a shortcut, like if someone has done it, I would have just asked how, but I'll do it on my own only.

Thanks anyways üòÖ
06/07/2020, 8:59 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): There is a field called ForeignKey in django models, which works exactly like the Foreign key in SQL
06/07/2020, 11:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I had a question,is there any harm in putting semicolon at the end of every statement in MySQL?
06/07/2020, 11:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): or can some1 just tell me when are semi-colons reqd. in SQL,I am kinda confused with this as  I saw tutorials where they almost never use it
06/07/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 82916 21138: Actually semicolon is used to end a query.
06/07/2020, 11:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes got it now'
07/07/2020, 12:11 am - Vivek Iyer (TSEC, Biomed): In python u can use range function to create table
07/07/2020, 12:11 am - Vivek Iyer (TSEC, Biomed): Tables*
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^[^aeiou]
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): can any1 explain what this means in SQL
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): its a regex
07/07/2020, 1:24 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No no,
I'm talking about Django
Class based SQL tables for backend
07/07/2020, 1:48 am - Tushar Nankani: This type of regex probably means it should start with _aeiou._
07/07/2020, 1:51 am - Tushar Nankani: And it should probably be ```^[aeiou]```. I am not too sure.

07/07/2020, 1:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): of*

07/07/2020, 9:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.

I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.

10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example git sparse-checkout was added in a 0.1 update.

10/07/2020, 6:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Focus on 1 thing at a time....
10/07/2020, 6:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't jump around everything.
I've tried and I've failed....

10/07/2020, 6:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Pick 1 thing and work on it until you have 3-4 projects on it.
10/07/2020, 6:49 pm - +91 97027 35002: These are so nice
10/07/2020, 6:49 pm - +91 97027 35002: Thanks
10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): What is HomeBrew ? Is this for Mac only?
10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not technially, no.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It was developed as a package mangager for Mac.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): But what is HomeBrew?
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Similar to apt and apk.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Package manager like Linux has apt...
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Exactly.
10/07/2020, 7:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is also availiable for linux.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It has limited use, except in very rare situations.
One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Means you don't have to be root to install software.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can "isolate" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Are u trying to install git?? That‚Äôs why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Oh acha
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - +91 97681 67131: Thought so, I also did the same recently üòÖ. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation.
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeahh thats what i did
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - +91 97681 67131: I don‚Äôt think that works in terminal on OSX
10/07/2020, 7:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): not only git i did 'brew install git'
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - +91 97681 67131: Did u first try installing homebrew, wait I‚Äôll share tutorials I followed... just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah i installed HomeBrew first
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): then through terminal i did brew install git
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): but it seems ki when you install Xcode , git gets installed too
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh then do u have Xcode installed and before that pls check software update section, command line tools installing happens from there...
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah i have Xcode
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Software update section?
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope it‚Äôs not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - +91 97681 67131: I mean where u get os updates
10/07/2020, 7:34 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): It just shows Your mac is up to date
10/07/2020, 7:35 pm - +91 97681 67131: Try running git‚Äîversion command is it giving back any version or no ?? If not I think some installing issue.. I will find tutorial I used.
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah it gives the version number
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): git is installed
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 97681 67131: Then it‚Äôs installed
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): just wanted to know about Home Brew
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh üòÇ Ya oh I thought stuck with installing
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): loll
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): XCode has old packages sometimes.
Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0.
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): I'll check
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yup its 2.27.0
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Great!
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 !
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah abhi i got to know
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Anytime üòÖ
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Thanks
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): apt uses dpkg internally.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): It went over my head lol
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya ya.. it‚Äôs installer sorry
10/07/2020, 7:42 pm - +91 97681 67131: But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right??
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies.
But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Ohhh

18/07/2020, 10:41 am - +91 82916 21138: The following order of learning would make sense.

Core Java - it is important to start with core Java for understanding the fundamental in Java programming.

Servlets - JSP and Servlet are important to understand the web technologies

Java EE

Spring Framework

Hibernate Framework



Java is a very vast language and used in various forms like Socket programming, Web Application development, Portal designing, Android applications, Purely Backend developments using Webservices and lot more. So first decide what you want to learn.

Learn accordingly.

1. Core Java : Most Important . Learn all the concepts don‚Äôt miss a single one. Its the heart and soul of Java

2. JSP and Servlet : These are basics of Web application development. Earlier all the applications were made using these technology but now they are just a part of Web development.

3. JDBC : You should be familiar with this concepts . Your daily life belongs to this only. Learn basics of SQL language also for CRUD operation.

4.Spring: The most useful framework which is used for various applications .

5.Hibernate: Its useful for DB interaction at the highest speed.

You can follow the 12345 all for a Spring web application development.

You can follow 1235 for Hibernate developer.

You can learn only 1 for Socket programming.

If you want to be a Android developer then learn only 1 and then proceed to android studio.

Except this you can learn JSF and Webservices for better knowledge and work

19/07/2020, 10:26 am - +91 82916 21138: Prashasti Agarwal:
I am graduating this year and I have job offer of 3-4 LPA. Should I focus on preparing for GATE or for DSA and CP?

Satbir Singh:
It's your wish. Remember GATE will give one chance per year to prove your worth whereas if you do CP and you're prepared you can get many chance to attend various interviews.

Anurag Goel:
After doing GATE, you will be doing M.Tech and again focussing on coding skills, Cp and DSA  for placement season after 2 years.

So it would be better if you switch your 3-4 lpa to 8-10+ lpa in product based company by learning those coding skills self.
I've been exactly at the same position as you are today and can feel the dilemma but if job is the end goal, better to grind yourself now with DSA coding skills along with existing job.

19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do you know about the Artic Seed Vault?
It's to protect the original seeds, because in these days, hybrid seeds ke vajha se original seeds are vanishing.

This code thing, I feel GitHub is just doing for publicity.
Maybe, just a marketing stunt.
19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol
19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yaa this is what i thinküòÇüòÇ

19/07/2020, 2:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Guys I had a security issue
19/07/2020, 2:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I accidentally pushed my Firebase google json file to my repo ,does it cause any potential risks?
19/07/2020, 2:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I deleted it now but it was there for like 2 weeksüôà
19/07/2020, 2:03 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But if someone really wants to get it they can go to your older commits
19/07/2020, 2:04 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): yeah
19/07/2020, 2:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fuck
19/07/2020, 2:04 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): change the password of your accounts
19/07/2020, 2:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Firebase console right?
19/07/2020, 2:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh bhai
19/07/2020, 2:04 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Nooooo
19/07/2020, 2:05 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): ?
19/07/2020, 2:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Does firebase json contain any critical information as such?
19/07/2020, 2:05 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes sir, but not for your Googke accounts
19/07/2020, 2:06 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Delete the project in your console and make a new project. You can migrate the data
19/07/2020, 2:06 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohküëç
19/07/2020, 2:06 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But still can they Access my console?
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): No
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Don't ever make this mistake again, include it in your .gitignore file asap
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): No
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah will
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): They can only manipulate your project and it's data, which is bad
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But its still there in my older committs ig
19/07/2020, 2:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Also, if you have good security rules, you should be fine
19/07/2020, 2:08 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah that's why you need a new project
19/07/2020, 2:08 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Take no chances
19/07/2020, 2:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Firebase right?

19/07/2020, 2:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): No need to make new project
19/07/2020, 2:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
19/07/2020, 2:10 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Why?
19/07/2020, 2:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Just remove the app from settings
19/07/2020, 2:11 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): You will have to create a new project though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

19/07/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): App ID is which is Imp just look that after re adding the app app ID is changed
19/07/2020, 2:13 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So you mean that a new project need not be created?
19/07/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes if app id is changed that u don't need to do make new project
19/07/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok then
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Will have connect it againüòì
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Very painful process as Android studio does a lot of nautanki
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Are you sure there is no other security concern?
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): @918080142783 any inputs?

19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Srsly needed
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Making a new project is the best option but this will be a lot of work
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Do this till then
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): If I make a new project then code will still be the same right?
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Only thing which important is app ID and API key
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Only I will have to set up the connection again?
19/07/2020, 2:18 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah and migrate app data in Firebase (idk how it's done though)
19/07/2020, 2:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nothing was there luckily

19/07/2020, 2:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Hey this is nice, @918291679151!

My opinions:
- In mobile view, get the number pad above the operator pad
- Make the operators visible in the box.
- The press handling is a little difficult. (Idk how you can improve that...)

- Add CSS transitions (literally 1 line of CSS)
- Adjust the padding so that there are no scrollbars (at least on Desktop)
- It is very bad practice for UI to shift. Make your buttons not shift on hover.

20/07/2020, 10:23 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Not a one time thing
This happens when you've already created a table in the database which has a few entries and now you try to add a new column
So what django is saying is that since the field you've given is non-nullable, django can't just give null value to it, and so, you'll have to assign a default value to all the existing entries in the table
20/07/2020, 10:33 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes correct.
I just wanted to change.
Needed to add 2 columns

        f++;

    }

    return f;
}```
22/07/2020, 5:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have to add logic to handle 0 and negative numbers.
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ```
vector<int> divs;
int check(int x) {

        if(x%i == 0) {

22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): try this
22/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 1. Java
2. No need for a vector
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): this will TLE if n is prime. But I think there isn't any time constraint on Udemy, so this will also work
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Lets say N is 10^9 + 7
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use n = 5
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): your loop will run 10^9 + 7 times
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Easier.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And no.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Wait, is 10e9 + 7 prime?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yes it will
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): yeah

22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Ah, then yes.
22/07/2020, 5:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Here I have optimized it. Consider any number N, if its not prime then it'll definitely have a factor <= sqrt(N)
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): so Time Complexity is O(sqrt(n))
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I was aiming for simplicity, but OK.
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah both solutions should work

07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So write a function to take the json data and create the required markup.
07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Have a for loop in the templating syntax that you're using and then add the necessary data in that

07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917304357388 No, that is server side rendering.
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The data is retrieved directly from the database.

07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 73043 57388: Your are dynamically creating a HTML element?

Actually I was thinking about that exactly

Is it possible to dynamically create DIV element for each JSON object retrieved?

10/08/2020, 12:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: and then in terminal give python manage.py (ip addr):8000
10/08/2020, 12:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: 8000 is what i use
10/08/2020, 12:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Side note: You can use ```py``` instead of typing ```python``` each time.

11/08/2020, 7:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Google is promoting other languages only because Oracle acquired Java,and maybe thats the reason why there is widespread hate for itüò±
11/08/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: Then why does Google foobar only take submissions is java or python?
11/08/2020, 7:37 pm - +91 98337 26449: *in
11/08/2020, 8:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Google Foobar is rumoured to be a recruitment strategy of the past. It's still present as a challenge, but I've read that they've stopped recruiting through that.
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Maybe because its very popular and easy to learn
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: It still puts you in their radar. Or else they would've completely canned it.
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah maybe.
11/08/2020, 8:56 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Google is shifting from java because it have some licensing issues
11/08/2020, 8:57 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah I heard this too
11/08/2020, 8:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It was a stupid move by Oracle imo. They're killing off Java...
11/08/2020, 8:59 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And Flutter can never replace native...it is true google is try to push kotlin through it.
11/08/2020, 9:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
11/08/2020, 9:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But the fuchsia OS will be totally flutter based right!?
11/08/2020, 9:08 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Will it be able to take over most popular OS?
11/08/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î interesting question tbh maybe I heard they are filling all gaps of android and making it
11/08/2020, 9:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I have already told this but think of replacing millions of android devices
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah  it will be gradual process but still üòÖ maybe fuchsia becomes new update of android and from there on things change or something like that ü§î
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like android has already started removing some stuff
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This can never happen...
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik
11/08/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I mean android is changing although so maybe idk who knows the future üòÖ

11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Changing a os means bye bye to your data
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes

11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik but I mean  they will declare last version of android and then declare after this it will be Fuchsian
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): No not gonna happen
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like and Android's last version might look similar to Fuchsian maybe  kind of like that so smooth switch ü§î
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Leaving support for millions of devices is not simple and thing they can do as a company
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: True
11/08/2020, 9:26 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î yeah true thing but what I read is that they are planning to make something which all iot device etc can use etc so don't know

11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definately not.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can change you OS without loosing your data.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As long as it is implemented properly.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If I flash a custom rom for it's recommended for a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): **recommended**
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And that is because they don't know what your previous OS was.
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yaa i tried not to and it gave me errors while boot so i did a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 9 to 10 and the stock was released on 9
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you know which OS the phone is running, and you have can push (signed) OTA updates, you can do almost anything.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, this is a custom rom.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Don't you think fuchsia will have totally different file structure and permissions?
11/08/2020, 9:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î maybe true
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes can be
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if they do, it is trivial to copy over all data from the old locations to the new one.
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): App data?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fuchsia won't be Linux based right?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now app data, I agree, will be quite difficult to port.
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And will OEMs will do itüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol
11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): So the mistake i did was that twrp didn't supported restore for android 10 and without knowing this is tried to restore app data
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): So you can't get android 10 in anyway?
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: I had put resurrection remix
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa twrp plays tweaks like that
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): You can why not?
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But why you couldn't? didn't get it?
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - +91 99693 94098: Big F. Should've used a compatible twrp. If you could overwrite the recovery with a compatible version, you could've fixed the issue
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Did you lose all app data?
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: Android 10 has scoped storage so you can't directly shift data
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Again you couldn't execute any command in fastboot... this was first thing that i tried
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I want to try to go from Android 6 to Android 10 on my old phone,will definitely tryüòÇ

11/08/2020, 9:52 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'm not sure about the zenfone tbh but there are fastboot roms. That would be my first step actually. Anyway, as long as you got it fixed üòÇüôåüèº
11/08/2020, 9:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically driver files.

11/08/2020, 9:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Fastboot flashable ROMs. As I said I'm not sure of zenfone but devices like samsung and miui have Odin and miui flash tool
11/08/2020, 9:56 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I tried the official asus flash toolkit but it required to run in fastboot

11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You mean a 1TB SSD and 1TB HDD?
11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Are you sure?
11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A 1TB SSD is *not* cheap.
11/08/2020, 10:10 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Yeah
11/08/2020, 10:11 pm - Tushar Nankani: 1TB SATA is 1 TB SSD?
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Tushar Nankani: According to what I have read, for gaming laptops, 512 SSD and 4 GB graphic card would work the best.
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Wait I am confused. What I have seen mostly are the ones with 1TB hddand 256 GB SSD.

This one laptop says 1TB SATA
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Sata is ssd?
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: Gaming laptops are not worth the money
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: Go for a PC instead
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 88798 05171: No
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: SATA is an interface

13/08/2020, 11:51 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Guys,
Suppose I have a US based server hosting my website. Now I wanna get a storage service for my website (Amazon S3)
Would it be better if I get a US based storage or an indian one?
13/08/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not enough details.
13/08/2020, 11:54 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): What do you need?
13/08/2020, 11:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Details.
13/08/2020, 12:00 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Lmao
13/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Elaborate on what details you need Kartikkkk

13/08/2020, 12:02 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): What details?üòÇ

Alright, so it's a django based website
So I need the storage to upload images from the admin panel and display it to the users
So I was thinking whether it'll be better if I had an indian based storage since the users are from india
13/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *THESE* details.
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So why is the website hosted in the US?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Won't the AWS CDN handle that?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Django ü§©

13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah, but it can cache stuff, so it won't have to keep fetching stuff from the US, right?

13/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 75078 05454: üòÇ it's difficult to make that library work with gcc. You have to get a ported version and then link the library while compiling. Even then the things that can be drawn with that library make you feel like you have time travelled to 2009 üòÇ
13/08/2020, 2:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I really dk why such stuff is being taught to us, instead theu could teach Graphics in Python/Java
13/08/2020, 2:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C/C++ is used for system programming
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know how Graphics are drawn in Python/Java?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It ultimately falls back to C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Would like to üòõ
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): By converting in C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hai na?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But thats dead imo
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why would we do that work? libraries hai na Java/Python mai
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Nah bro
Even paint and all built using C/C++
I heard
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): How do you think Python Was built ?
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ha but do we really have to rebuild the wheelü§î
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes bro C/C++ are base of all languages I understand
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, but you should understand how the wheel works.
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's for those who want it get into Graphics
Suppose Game Dev me bhi
If you see the Game Engines are also built using C+++
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True but....turbo C++ use karna zaroori hai uske liyeüòÇ
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 75078 05454: we should be learning 3d graphics using opengl or something
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C++
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That I agree with.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C#
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But after basic graphics.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): graphics.h is obsolete right?
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We use C# while building games
But
The actual Engine
Unity is built using C++

13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): @918080142783 if they are doing graphics cpp and their libraries are old then how morden languages are using it?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Like are they modifying it or something else?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, graphics.h is depricated because modern processors support SIMD.
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Or calling its methods internally
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): SIMD is Single Instruction, Multiple Data.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if you want to add/multiply 4 sets of numbers then you can do it in 1 operation.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): So the languages are using this and we are learning graphics.h?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is easier to understand SIMD once you know what the hell you are actually doing with the data.
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ooh
13/08/2020, 2:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But sometimes you can skip bicycleüòÅ

120 CS + 120 IT + 60 Extc + 60 Biomedical + 60 BioTech + 60 Chemical = 480
.¬∞.Total number of students in all 4 years=480*4=1920(minimum no of students)
Tution fees per sem = 129545
Consider in worst case 50% students as OBC/EBC
No of obc/ebc students=960
.¬∞.Rem students=960
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by obc/ebc students= 960*129545*0.5 =62181600
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by regular students= 960*129545=124,363,200
Total tution fees gained per year = 186,544,800
Total college development feea gained per year = 1920*12955 = 24,873,600

Total income of college per year(worst case) = 186544800+24873600 = 211,418,400 = 21.14Cr

Now with such an amount of income considering the fees to be given to teachers,other staffs,electricity bill and cost of devices,etc..still there must be a decent amount of money left with the authority, where that goes!!!!!!

24/08/2020, 3:12 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion:

Do everything yourself, college is mostly useless.

Do DBMS and DSA yourself, they are really important.
DSA: Please code things out yourself. Try to code out all the DS and their types yourself. DSA Sorting: GFG has short vids on all sorts on YT. They are your bible.

Imp vid: SQL and ER diags: https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY

Do a small crash course on core Java. It's moderately important. Please don't go for any long course.

PCE is just mugging up.

What is comp. prog. fundas!? We didn't have that. Idr what we had in place of that lol
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): DSA should we learn only in C or other languages as well?
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion: Do everything from YT. Don't take any courses, even if they are free.
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): C for now.

24/08/2020, 3:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion:

DSA: PLEASE code things yourself. If you want to refer to a book, not required of you've paid attention in class, 'DS and algo in C'.

DBMS: Do the SQL vid that I shared. I would not recommend a book. Use Techmax.

26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As I said, speed.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Speed?
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Notepad++ opens in like 300 ms.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): R u talking about command line vim?
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.

26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ab yeh kya hai!?
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: I started on that only

26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: Arm architecture..
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Windows ‚ù§Ô∏è
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Virtualbox.
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Docker?
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I would better use windowsüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Or Linux
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Hypervisor?
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: This is kinda useless until have a good specked laptop u can‚Äôt really run Xcode simulator completely I tried a lot..
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I am skeptical about long term feasibility.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Noooooo ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: So last resort hackintosh... though driver support is pathetic üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have completely missed the point.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes as Microsoft is also pushing arm now
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope I guess they might just have it I was watching WWDC 2020 Rosetta 2 seems promising
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Pushing arm is not the issue.
(Arm actually has better performance for lower price)
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: They can‚Äôt make it happen for that u need control over hardware as well
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: They failed once remember snapdragon 835 laptop

26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 86559 19035: And lower thermals
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 97681 67131: Windows ka some hp or Lenovo built in 2018 ig
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): They are partnering with Qualcomm for chipset and supporting them
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 86559 19035: Doesn't mean always
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): +1
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The only reason big companies (Adobe/Autodesk) write hight performance software for Macs is because it is 99% similiar to Windows.
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the extra effort is justified.
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (And almost negligible)
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): After foldable from Microsoft i think they will do it
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know I read that now issue is they are different companies after all so how things work out is interesting also interesting is to see what amd and intel have in stock...
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But if Windows and Mac instruction sets diverge, then most software will either stop supporting mac, or will use the automatice translation tools and take a huge performance hit.
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 86559 19035: Amd is beating intel with ryzen for now in most places at lower costs
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes because intel n amd will suffer the most
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: True agreed but I know if someone in the industry can make such big changes though foolish and work for them in their favour it‚Äôs got to be Apple...
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not every time.
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True but will developer take enough efforts?
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 86559 19035: They have given transition period for now and pro stuff stays on intel for now
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 86559 19035: So we have to see what happens
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Adobe does NOT support the latest Mac Pro or the ludicrously expensive "Pro display".
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya that‚Äôs the catch Mac app support in App Store isn‚Äôt gr8 anyway, with arm chips Apple can bring mobile developers as in iPad OS and iOS developers to develop as well
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but that will be throwing away like 35+ YEARS of desktop developers.
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Imagine the knowledge and experience.
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 86559 19035: Not exactly
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: I agree but I feel they can pull this one off...
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - +91 97681 67131: Plus they aren‚Äôt throwing anything to trash Rosetta 2 is helping not arm optimised apps to run at least
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Do u know how irritating it is to develop a UI for different screen sizeü•∫
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Forget UI, do you know how irritating it is to optimize for a different INSTRUCTION SET?
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ig they will Microsoft already had office ready on WWDC 2020 announced day to run on Mac so... Also it‚Äôs Apple a trillion dollar market cap company they can make it happen...
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Never did thatüòÇüòÖ
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): It will take a loooonng time
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even today, most server software has two versions: Windows (semi-supported) and Linux.
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - +91 97681 67131: That‚Äôs the catch, since Apple has selected number of products which often use same screen sizes say like se 2020 which is iPhone 6 ka screen only so it‚Äôs much easier for them...
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MariaDB straight up has this warning: If you compile this on Mac, then anything that happens is your problem.
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: They themselves mention 2 yrs transition time.. let‚Äôs see üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya Agreed
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Who will install mac for serverüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, they mean even for development.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ohh
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 97681 67131: Let‚Äôs see what pans out for the future of intel and amd specially cause that‚Äôs most interesting to me if this plan succeeds.... They won‚Äôt go without a fight it‚Äôs sure...
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh they are not going anywhere.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): one question:
why are most servers linux based?
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Apple n EpicüòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if all consumer products switch to arm, legacy servers will still need maintainence.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918080142783
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I think Epic will win
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And don't forget mainframes.
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know but they might have to market their product differently or themselves make arm chips if Apple and Microsoft can pull arm transition off
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Open source so lot of libraries available
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Natively
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Two reasons:
- No licensing issues
- Raw performance.
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya also performance...
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And the performance part comes from being open source.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if you don't want a network driver (for whatever reason), simply delete the code for networking and suddenly you have the best performing kernal for your application.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok yeah open source
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): quick bug fuxes
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you can fix a bug yourself if needed.
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya this is the main reason lot of restrictions in Windows especially OSX for this üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ha
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh yes.
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The source code of Windows has been leaked once or twice but I don't think anyone was able to compile it.
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): wow
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - +91 97681 67131: Wow when??
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't remember exactly, but not too long ago.
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya I remember even Xbox source code was leaked
26/08/2020, 12:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): compile it?why not?
26/08/2020, 12:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ig whole source codes were never leaked
26/08/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Maybe ~3 years?

26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Who is SSS?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > Anagha maam

What do you mean by best teacher?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In all her lectures, all she has done is read from the ppt.
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: We had her in SE too
But sem 4, i don't remember if sem 3
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ??
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like literally read out the slide line by line.
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Reminds me of Primary school teachers üòÖ
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: Just a teacher most of the students avoid

26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And she also gave use some gems like:
"When you switch on the voltage of the current ..."
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): She forced some ppl to switch their web cams on
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): That was boss moment üòÇ
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
She did here too
But she mentioned it was all new for her and it would make her comfortable seeing faces
So that's understandable
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, electron energy gets converted to visual energy.
26/08/2020, 5:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah thats cool actually
26/08/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 98337 47258: We have her too but I just log in and move away

26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Umm, not really
She won't have a civil discussion
Her physical lecs seemed horrible
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Her most of the lecs just used to be mass bunks
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: She just used to read out
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Really? I have had a LOT of discussions with her.
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No. Are you sure this is the same teacher?

27/08/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But a VERY big red flag for almost anything related to computers is when the same input gives you different outputs.
27/08/2020, 6:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if running the same program twice with the same input gives different answers then something has gone horribly wrong.
27/08/2020, 6:28 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): The entire reason chaos theory came into being is that a computer gave out different outputs. Read a little about it. It's a different case but an interesting read

03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes exactly I was trying to avoid that
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 97027 35002: To first take string input
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): isliye ek empty nextLine() da;a
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 97027 35002: Then baki sab
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): dala
03/09/2020, 12:38 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ya fir avoid nextLine()

03/09/2020, 12:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Change
```String name = s.nextLine();
s.nextLine();```
to
```s.nextLine();
String name = s.nextLine();```
03/09/2020, 12:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright
thanks
03/09/2020, 12:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And I understood also what wrong I did
Lol
03/09/2020, 12:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): so petty mannn
03/09/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Good.
03/09/2020, 12:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Works like a charm!
Thanks
03/09/2020, 12:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because I have repeated this explaintaion 5 times.
03/09/2020, 12:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
03/09/2020, 12:47 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ah this
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Dummy string right?
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): .
03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's to clear the channel.
The previous input ka enter is still in the channel
And if I don't give
s.nextLine();
 Before the string input
Vo enter gets stored in the string ka variable

So isliye
To avoid that.
03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): üò§
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 97027 35002: Just remember to this whenever you take a interger etc input before taking string input
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 97027 35002: Integer*
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, no.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There's another workaround to this too
Which is buffer flush or something
But I am lazy so nextLine():
Se kar leta hai
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK listen.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok sir.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ab khatamüòÇ
03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 97027 35002: Idt java me there is something like flushall()
03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines.
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So, imagine Scanner gets the inputs:
```10\nHello, World!\n```
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Didn't see the code
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes ik
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does.
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 97027 35002: Explain sir
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace.
03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\d+/```
03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits.
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okay
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it.
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now the stream is: ```\nHello, World!\n```
03/09/2020, 12:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does.
03/09/2020, 12:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer.
03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\n```).
03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (without the newline)
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\nHello, World!\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline.
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So basically
It returned nothing in my case
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which means it will return an empty string.
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright.
Got it.
Thank you.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohhhhh
03/09/2020, 1:03 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okayyy

Collaboration of 2 committees really helps an event grow bigger, ACM sets up the events, E-Cell and it's connections help with perks and opportunities like paid internships. I wonder if we could do something like this in our college?

So we have a pre recorded video just so that you can set up your systems for Flutter Development.

Here's the video:
https://bit.ly/flutter_installation

Go through it
And follow it.
If you face any issues while installation, hit me up,
I'll help you out!
11/09/2020, 9:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Cool will
11/09/2020, 10:35 am - Tushar Nankani: Hi everyone!

Just a request to all of you, if you see your classmates, your friends, or even acquaintances, coming up with content/ideas/YouTube videos/Instagram influencer, it's very new for them, and if you find even one thing good/creative/informative/entertained:

_Never hesitate and go ahead and message and appreciate them!_

(Ego might be a problem here sometimes, but it won't help anyone except the ego itself XD)

It would mean so much to them, you have no idea!

It would really, really boost their confidence, by your words! üôåüèª

I'll tell you what
I have this one principle:
If you are interested in something, learn it
If you are not interested in something, learn only so much
That someone else can't rip you off.

Like you must be smart enough to understand whether something is good/bad for you

Also must seek guidance of that person who knows about it and you trust them.

13/09/2020, 11:06 am - +91 97739 65140: no
13/09/2020, 11:06 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ab konsa error?üòÇ

13/09/2020, 11:11 am - +91 97739 65140: Take your time guys. This is really difficult and quite a twist in its own imo
13/09/2020, 11:14 am - +91 97739 65140: And let me know if you guys want a hint??
13/09/2020, 11:15 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Precedence of the && is more than || right?
13/09/2020, 11:15 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Do bhai
13/09/2020, 11:15 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:16 am - Tushar Nankani: My mind is saying, error dega, because shouldn't it be == instead of =

And now that you mentioned precedence, ```and``` has higher precedence than ```or```. But you have mentioned that explicitly, so I am confused üòÇ

13/09/2020, 11:17 am - +91 97739 65140: Simple hint is think about precedence and prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes, but why??
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got it
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wait
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Pehle a = True hua
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That executes
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Theek hai
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: no, it doesn't give error. This is valid in java, only if you put it in if then will it give an error
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then we have or
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Any thing or with true is true
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So
Baki 2 exp don't get executed
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 91725 67828: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: yes, but kya bhai??
Ideally nhi shona chahiye
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - +91 97739 65140: *hona
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Brackets phele hona chaiye right?
Saare
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ideally
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - +91 97739 65140: this is what is happening but think in terms of precedence, this should not happen
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes got you
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - Tushar Nankani: boolean a=false,b=false,c=false,x=false;
        x = ((a = true) || (b = true) && (c = true));
        System.out.print (a + "," + b + ", " + c);
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - Tushar Nankani: What about this?
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - +91 97739 65140: still it should give true, false, false
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - +91 97739 65140: If you want to understand the logic, think in terms of prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919773965140
Aisi cheeze bhej te raho
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Massssst hai
13/09/2020, 11:23 am - +91 97739 65140: üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:24 am - +91 97739 65140: If anyone of you don't get it, then I will explain
13/09/2020, 11:24 am - +91 97739 65140: what's happening here
13/09/2020, 11:25 am - +91 88284 70904: I understood the false false scenario coz it‚Äôs happening due to precedence
13/09/2020, 11:26 am - +91 88284 70904: But the first true ka m not getting
13/09/2020, 11:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): -126?
13/09/2020, 11:27 am - +91 97694 89970: Yes correct :)
13/09/2020, 11:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn how?
13/09/2020, 11:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean System.out.println() is an overloaded method
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It supports all data types if Im not wrongüòÖ
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - +91 97739 65140: x+y is an int
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - +91 97739 65140: Not byte
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Accha waise
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh F ha
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ShittüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I've never used byte till nowüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 97739 65140: Wait till you see the magic of Strings in JavaüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, I still don't get how?
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Strings sab language ka ajeeb he lagta haiüòÖ
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Strings in Java are cool
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 97739 65140: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nah C/C++ ke sabse ajeb hai
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - +91 97739 65140: smallest storage register size is integer not byte
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - +91 97739 65140: So, anything smaller than int if you operate them it will always result in int
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay
But you declared them as byte ba?
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Na*
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: .
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: This rule holds
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97694 89970: If we apply any arithmetic operator between two variables a and b, then the result type is always *max(int , type of a, type of b)*
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh okay
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: üëçüèªüî•üî•
13/09/2020, 11:33 am - +91 97739 65140: Bro, in this if you know how expressions are executed
You will know we make prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:33 am - +91 82916 21138: True,false ,false cause left to right Jayega I guess
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ‚úÖ
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This ik
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - +91 82916 21138: I had seen this question in my tenth prelims üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:36 am - +91 97694 89970: c ka false kaise aaya?
I'm getting true false true ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
13/09/2020, 11:36 am - +91 97739 65140: In this case prefix expression is :

||=aTrue&&=bTrue=cTrue


So, here || will operate on =aTrue first as if that is true then it need not go to right
13/09/2020, 11:37 am - +91 97739 65140: Bro, in simple words || is a short circuiting operator
13/09/2020, 11:37 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yess
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is short circuit operators ka magic
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - +91 97739 65140: So, if you have a||b,
If a is true, it doesn't operate b
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üôèüôè
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - +91 97739 65140: *execute b
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn Ive forgotten the basics
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Aur bhejo aiseüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Damn, your school op
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Sure
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 88284 70904: Bhai kya!!!????üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:40 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn our school set really dirty questions but is level tak nahi gaye hai
13/09/2020, 11:40 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
13/09/2020, 11:41 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëç
13/09/2020, 11:41 am - +91 97694 89970: Haa yeh barabar... Uske baad a= true aur b=false rahega. And then c ka?
&& ke pehle wala expression true hai par abhi aage bhi we have to check na?
13/09/2020, 11:42 am - +91 97739 65140: bro
13/09/2020, 11:43 am - +91 97739 65140: check this
13/09/2020, 11:43 am - +91 97739 65140: since || is the first operation here , it will short circuit . Had there been any other operation , it would have worked differently
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 97694 89970: Areyyy. Haa got it got it üôà
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ye abhi bhi nhi smajha
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 97739 65140: bro this is how computer evaluates your expressions
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97739 65140: sem 3 mein padhate hai in application of stacks
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97694 89970: Ahh. See yahi hua üòåüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): To swap two variables without a third one,this works in Java ig:
b= a+b - (a=b)
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97739 65140: prefix and postfix notation
13/09/2020, 11:46 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Abhi chal rha hai yeh
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Even the concept is very interesting
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Mujhe ghanta kuch samja nahi ye
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919773965140
How do I even attempt this üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - +91 97739 65140: bro, wait
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - +91 97739 65140: I am still on this
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okok
13/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 97739 65140: I guess this should work , but only if it is int, float, double.
You can't do this for others
13/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 98206 14506: Woah cool!
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - +91 91725 67828: x = (a = true) || *(*(b = true) && (c = true) *)*;

Precedence ki wajese you'll get these extra brackets,
But the associativity is still left to right, so a=true will remain the same
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - +91 82916 21138: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 11:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes it does
13/09/2020, 11:52 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): My mind can't even process this shitüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:52 am - +91 97694 89970: Woah üëåüèºüî•
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 82916 21138: Yeah this was in 10th too right tanay ?
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But the most efficient way is using ex-or
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 97739 65140: kya op hai
s=%r;print(s%%s)
??
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nope lol,not for me
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 82916 21138: Arrey ü§£ so mere school be muje Bohot mara phir toh üò°ü§¢
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 82916 21138: One more trick question which java developers gets confused doing c is the increment and decrement
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 82916 21138: Cause in java we go left to right but in c it's anything üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 97739 65140: very true
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Happy that Java was my first
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üôèüôè

13/09/2020, 11:55 am - +91 82916 21138: I had a fight with my professor last sem on a increment and decrement üòÇ while c programming lectures
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Major F
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 82916 21138: Since I was from java background she started telling me you are wrong etc etc and it turned out both were right üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 97739 65140: abbey yaar this is python 2 ka format syntax

13/09/2020, 11:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Self replicating code
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - +91 97739 65140: so , you have something like print('hi %s bye'%('Dheeraj'))
This is python 2 formatting
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Idk about %r
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - +91 97739 65140: so here he did print(s%s)

13/09/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is HEAVILY used for data processing.
13/09/2020, 12:50 pm - +91 97694 89970: Ohh yess true. Byte is the best choice if we want to handle data in terms of strings either from the file or from the network.
I saw the usage of it in Serialization concept.
13/09/2020, 1:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Another good question,predict the O/p:
(alert:you need to know a bit of pre-defined non-primitive data types for this and some OOP)

public class Demo{
    public static void main(String[] arr){
        Integer num1 = 100;
        Integer num2 = 100;
        Integer num3 = 500;
        Integer num4 = 500;

        if(num1==num2){
            System.out.println("num1 == num2");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("num1 != num2");

13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah but...one hiny
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I know 1 thing
that
All these nums are objects
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): close enough but one concpet threw you off
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): concept*

13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - +91 82916 21138: ? Why ?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ruk ja let sufficient ppl try,if you want I will dm it to you
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: We can compare objects right .?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: DM Kar
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes but....
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Chal
It is related to range onlt na?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa Nahi bolunga
13/09/2020, 2:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): closer
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): range is like byte

-128 to 127
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): for some important thing
13/09/2020, 2:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @919769489970  @919773965140  do try this one!
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): B?

13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): but why?
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ill tell you
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): woh bataüòÇ

13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I think so
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): üòÇüòÇ
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mein ese he feka tha
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you want to compare objects
equals() use karna chaiye
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not ==
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Haa a reason
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): here is the answer:

Answer: b)num1 == num2
                  num3 != num4
Reason: We always thought that whenever two object references are compared using ‚Äú==‚Äù, it always evaluates to ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. But here Integer caching changes the results.Integer class has a caching range of -128 to 127. Whenever a number is between this range and autoboxing is used, it assigns the same reference. That‚Äôs why for value 100, both num1 and num2 will have the same reference, but for the value 500 (not in the range of -128 to 127), num3 and num4 will have different reference.
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I knew this for String
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String ke liye always same location hota hai
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String pool ki vjh se
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yesssss
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mereko laga ki jo issue hota hai bade numbers mein hota hai issleye smaller number would be trueüòÇ
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): if you want different String then use String Builder/Buffer

13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yessss right mahn. I was trying to recollect auto boxing and unboxing.
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah,I always used to take it for granted
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Unbox TherapyüòÇ.
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ki Integer = int

13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - +91 83292 66084: Yup
13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919769489970
Vo byte wale me bhi yehi hota hai
13/09/2020, 3:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Overflow hoke negative side pe gaya
13/09/2020, 3:39 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yes bro. Byte se Int ho jaataa hai woh, phir bcoz of compound assignment operator downcasting or narrowing JVM automatically karta hai jiske karan memory loss hota hai and we get 130 ka in byte as  -126.

But there's a small catch here, agar b = b + 3 likha hota toh humko error milta tha ;)
13/09/2020, 3:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes!
13/09/2020, 3:47 pm - +91 97739 65140: num1==num2

13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - +91 97739 65140: Because I know Java Strings
And I have done a lot of ungli with integers in python
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - +91 97739 65140: Same concept is applied there too
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh lol
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have not messed much with Python but Java yes
13/09/2020, 3:51 pm - +91 97739 65140: Try this:

13/09/2020, 4:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Right?
13/09/2020, 4:33 pm - +91 97694 89970: Agar null consider karte toh bhi false false true hi aata

13/09/2020, 5:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): so maybe
13/09/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 97739 65140: do you know tuples?

I thought Python does have argument destructuring???
13/09/2020, 6:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917021825025 What do you mean?
13/09/2020, 6:53 pm - +91 70218 25025: It does but not fully yet, like suppose you have an object or a dictionary with around 10 15 entries but in current context you want to work on just few of them so youd have to write something like
a = d[key].
But in js or something you can take that key value by saying let { a } = d
13/09/2020, 6:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Itn't there a ```**``` operator for things like that?

13/09/2020, 7:40 pm - +91 70218 25025: These spread operators are used to accept variable length arguments, but what im saying is ke when you need only few things, the desturcturing in python gives you everything, you arent able to selectively destructure what you want.

13/09/2020, 7:44 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can write a method yourself if you reallllly want it.
13/09/2020, 7:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Something like:
```def d(dict, *keys):
    values = []
    for k in keys:
        values.append(dict[k])

    return values

dict = {"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2}
a, c = d(dict, "a", "c")```

The goal of that network is to make a custom filter which can handle the task better than just a predefined filter which might not be useful in all cases

14/09/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The correct way is:
1. Use a "clean" audio clip.
2. Introduce some noise.
3. Remove the noise with different methods.
4. Compare deviation from original waveform.

Regarding 3 you can try it out and check for yourself. The model isn't the best out there. It's fast enough for a user to run on colab which provides replicability which is the purpose of the article.

14/09/2020, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Since noise is usually low-amplitude anyways, is there any clear benefit from using an ML model at all.
14/09/2020, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This problem already has an (industy-accepted) solution, so how does your implemetation compare to it?
14/09/2020, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I agree that this is an interesting problem, and any research done here will definately be useful somewhere.
14/09/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 99693 94098: Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself
Apart from that, noise is low amplitude is not always true. A car horn isn't of a low amplitude. It might also lead to destructive interference or noise distortion. It's not as easy as using a simple filter to filter out every kind of noise
14/09/2020, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But what I don't like about ML/AI articles is they make it look like a magic silver bullet that can solve all problems.

Hmmm, in what context?
14/09/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'm saying this again, the model in the article is not supposed to be the best. It's supposed to be replicable. The implementation is derived from the SEGAN paper (as mentioned in the article also)

True, but at that point, you are no longer just removing noise, you are also reconstructing missing audio.

I realise the tradeoff of each implementation but I don't think it supposed to be in the article. The goal isn't to compare. Its to show how it can be done and how the problems can be addressed
14/09/2020, 12:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > I don't think it supposed to be in the article

I strongly disagree.

20/09/2020, 11:11 am - Tushar Nankani: I wouldn't mind such initiatives, that would help maintain the gender ratio!

Just that, it's rather sad the score difference is so vast!


Microsoft already has women in tech, Google has women techmaker's scholarship and so many more opportunities by other firms. There should be more gender neutral opportunities, based upon _skills._


I think, even if they have such opportunities, to maintain the ratio, at least score difference shouldn't be so much.

It's a debatable topic, and this is purely my point of view.
20/09/2020, 11:13 am - +91 88284 70904: If they r conducting a coding competition then obviously it should purely be on merit and plus they haven‚Äôt specified that it‚Äôs for women only or something. So in this case I think it‚Äôs completely wrong
20/09/2020, 11:14 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): In my opinion if they want to take only a specific gender then only allow them to compete...why to waste others time and make them feel bad of them selfs
20/09/2020, 11:14 am - +91 88284 70904: Exactly

20/09/2020, 11:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 1) You want women empowerment?
--> Conduct women-only hiring drives

2) Don't give false hopes for 1000s of candidates who work hard, score good, expecting they will get a call & then not get selected.

20/09/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but if it is women-only opportunity, then they should've  mentioned that.
20/09/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Exactly

20/09/2020, 12:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Because the industry should not be male dominated and have equal representation.

(What about the Trans and Queer people though? Do we have opportunities only for them?)
20/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Equal representation won't effect on growth.

20/09/2020, 12:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah well they are hired from a pool of female candidates rather than a mixed pool. This def creates an advantage for them to be hired and that is the point of that. Coming to the skills thing, yes there might be differences that will have to patched up later on...
20/09/2020, 12:26 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Well this is just what I think. Feel free to educate me if you think I'm wrong. üëç

20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah, this topic is a bit controversial
20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Opportunities should be given to who are working hard, not because of thier gender. No one had an option to be a male or a female but they have option to work on themselves and be better tomorrow.

20/09/2020, 2:19 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This might be the requirement at the time when the laws were written but today this is all political and I don't they are required now.
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Think*
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's where you're wrong. Because you can't just undo hundreds of years of underrepresentation.
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 98337 26449: In a couple of years
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: If you think that. Please don't become a manager/politician
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): There will be riots
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 47258: So who says what's been happening is right
Just bcs something happened doesn't mean it's correct,
People adopted slavery for ages but that doesn't justify it
They were given low opportunities back in the day
If you wanna give quotas, give on the basis on basis on wealth then
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: Ebc is that
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: Economically backward
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We all want reservation only on basis of wealth
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 47258: Why can't you
They were oppressed at a point. They aren't now
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: üòÇüòÇüòÇ so all has been undone? Magic? Tada
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It hurt a lot to see soo many seats go in reserved category
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Not in a click
But gradually yeah
There's been a huge change
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Just because you aren't getting it it hurts naa? If you did get it you would be happy af
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Talking about obc
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Think about it from the others perspective for once. Don't be so self absorbed
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Now  its purely on basis of votes
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Ik people so damn wealthy getting low grades and qualifying for IIT
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: Barely. Any change
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: Basically the moral of the story is. You guys are salty because you guys aren't getting it right?
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: No other reason
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean they need votes ,one who tries to touch the reservation policy gets burned
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: The truth is
Ones who weren't oppressed ones are the ones getting oppressed , getting low chances just bcs of the term "reserved"
There are equal opportunities for all now
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: If it was in your favou
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: You would be happy
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: *favour
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: No one goes for a job interview and says you are obc? You can't get it
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: It used to be there back in the day
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: So there's more women than men in Google now? Doubt x
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: No
We are salty bcs the undeserving ones get it
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Reservation was meant to be continued only for 10-15 years after independence
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ++
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): ++
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Exactly. So if you grandparents didn't get a job. That means they were labours. So automatically your father had lower opportunities
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Get it?
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's generations

20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 47258: Nope
More men bcs more men qualified and looked for jobs there
Not bcs they are men
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: One generation
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: You think you deserve to be at Google?
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: All of you?
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: So go with wealth
If my grandfather was obc
But I'm rich now
I don't think I should be given an edge
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: No
Never said that
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We deserve to have equal opportunities
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because it's been going on for generations. Some didn't even let their daughters study.
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Arre jobs ki kon baat kar raha hai we are now talking about quotas
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: But give to the ones who deserves
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: So when have you guys been oppressed?
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sir
Things are changing
If you wanna encourage then encourage their studies
Not give away jobs
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ++
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): That was because of mindset of thier parents no one stopped them
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: Taking away seats
What if I deserved a place
But half were reserved
I lost my place
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: It's 2020
Not 1920
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 26449: What if they pass a law tomorrow. Men aren't allowed to drive a car, vote or even go out as unmarried?
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): By running for better college even after getting better marks than my friend who got into IIT because of his certificate
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's real oppression
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 47258: If you discriminate even slightly now you don't go away free

20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think the argument is that if a man *deserves* to rule the world then he should not be denied because he is a man.
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 96374 40537: Exactly
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's the whole point of underrepresentation

20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): There was an OBJECTIVE MEASURE.
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Aka test scores.
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: Because the society that we live in now periodically favours men

20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: That's why we have these structures in place
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 96190 16721: It's not about chances, lets say government gives a woman land to do agriculture still the people will oppress her and tease her for doing that and not looking after the house chores
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: To uplift women
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: That's what they have feeded in your minds
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: To make role models

20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: So other women can look up to them
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: Women weren't allowed to vote right?
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's literally that way for women and African Americans. They've been oppressed for so long. That 10 years of Support isn't gonna go shit
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: At least for US I know

20/09/2020, 3:52 pm - Tushar Nankani: When I sent the message in the morning, the group was open for discussions. I wanted to know everyone's  _opinion_. We wanted to know what everyone thinks about it.

I didn't want the discussions to be directed at one another or this discussion to scale up into a messy debate. I don't know how it got all scaled up üòÇ

Yes, there are a lot of factors overlapping in situations like gender inequality and the caste system.

We all got to know about everyone's perspective to look at it. It's simply not black and white. I got to know a lot from this discussion.

Google has recently launched a new facilitator program called Google Cloud Crash Course. Google Cloud Crash Course program will provide engineering students an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Each campus can nominate one person to be a facilitator and lead this initiative in their college. Upon nomination and selection, these facilitators will receive some training on how to lead these sessions and motivate more students to participate.

If anyone here has some familiarity with cloud and is interested to become a facilitator, dm me.

23/09/2020, 1:49 pm - +91 82916 21138: We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:




Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer using recursion.



If x has only digit, then its super digit is x.
	Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.


For example, the super digit of 9875 will be calculated as:

            super_digit(9875)        9+8+7+5 = 29

            super_digit(29)            2 + 9 = 11

            super_digit(11)            1 + 1 = 2

            super_digit(2)              = 2

27/09/2020, 2:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hey there,

The other day I read this story of a fledgling Python coder named Seth on Reddit:

Seth's been learning Python for 5 months, and things have been "hit and miss" for a while now.

A few weeks ago he completed a free coding course. But since then his progress came to a grinding halt.

Seth's doing fine at the small exercises‚Äîwrite a function here, reverse this list there‚Äîbut when it comes to writing more substantial programs on his own, he just can't get them to work.

When Seth embarked on his "coding journey" a fire burned in his belly, but now he doesn't really feel enthusiastic about anything.

It's not like his motivation is dead and gone‚Äî

Every time he looks at the neat stuff he could use his programming skills for, he knows deep down that he WANTS to learn.

But the fire he once felt for Python and coding in general has faded into a dim glow at this point.

Seth started out learning Python with a friend, but his friend surpassed him within three weeks.

Seth still feels like a "noob," and when his friend texted him a link to one of his little web app side-projects, Seth ignored the message for days.

How come Seth's progress has been sitting at a standstill? How did he end up in this trap, feeling his stomach churn every time he thinks about writing another line of code?

Seth says he simply has no idea *what* to program in order to get better. He has no project, nor an idea he wants to get started with.

And he doesn't feel comfortable coding the programs he thinks he *should* be able to code by now. There's no going back or going forward.

I call this "Python Paralysis"...

When you're tired of slogging through another coding tutorial, putting in more effort than most people, but STILL not seeing results... you know why most people don't become professional programmers!

The real problem isn't the effort itself, it's all the other stuff that sabotages the effort.

If you're wondering, I speak from experience here.

Seth's story is pretty much exactly how I felt in the beginning of any big challenge I ever tackled in my life, whether that's learning how to program, getting my first coder job, or becoming self-employed and starting a business.

If you're in the same spot right now, here's what you need to realize:

If you get through this and keep pressing forward, you're going to get to a stage that's a whole lot better. Push through this, and your efforts will start paying off and people will start respecting you.

It takes guts and determination to make it past the "paralysis" and confusion. You need to have conviction, and a tolerance for pain.

Let me ask you this: How do you KNOW you have a dream? Like, REALLY know it?

When it hurts so bad that you can taste it. When you feel your heart lurch in your chest every time you think about the unfulfilled possibilities.

That's when you need to keep pushing forward, that's when you're oh so close to getting your reward, but you don't see it yet.

Don't throw in the towel. Keep pushing forward.

And take another step towards your goal.

Do watch!!!
01/10/2020, 3:29 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Those who have received the credits, they can view the program syllabus here-
https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/program-syllabus/#content
and start with their labs
Note-You will get the goodies only if you complete the tracks mentioned on the website

If you haven't received the credits, follow the steps in the image sent below
If you don't get the credits even after following those steps, you can use the "Chat" section on qwiklabs and tell them that you've followed the procedure and still didn't receive credits.
Mostly, they'll solve your problem, else they'll ask you to wait for the mail
As for the mail, I've asked the officials about the delay in receiving mails, they said they are sending out mail in batches, so you should receive yours latest by 2nd Oct night
